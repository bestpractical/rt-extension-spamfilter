NAME
    RT-Extension-SpamFilter - Spam Filter

DESCRIPTION
    This is for public RT systems, where everyone can create tickets. Admins
    can define a list of rules, and if an email comes from a non-existing
    user and reached the score threshold(scored by the rules), it will be
    marked as spam and no tickets will be created.

    Admins can manually handle those spams from /Tools/SpamFilter/List.html

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.0.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

            rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm; a sample configuration is shown
    below:

        Plugin('RT::Extension::SpamFilter');
        Set(@MailPlugins, 'SpamFilter', 'Auth::MailFrom');
        Set($SpamFilterThreshold, 30);
        Set(
            @SpamFilters,
            {
                Field => 'Subject',
                Regex => qr/urgent reply/i,
                Score => 20,
            },
            {
                Field => 'X-Gm-Spam',
                Regex => qr/1/,
                Score => 30, # Trust spam header and flag as spam
            },
            {
                Field => 'Body',
                Regex => qr/download the attachment/i,
                Score => 10
            }
        );

  @SpamFilters
    The @SpamFilters array is an array of hashes. Each hash must contain the
    following keys:

    Field
        Either 'Body' or the name of an email header.

    Regex
        A regular expression to apply to the email header named by Field (or
        the email body if Field is 'Body').

    Score
        A number indicating how many points to add to the spam score if the
        rule matches.

    You can use the configuration above to check for provided spam headers
    as shown in the example above. However, any score provided as a value in
    a header currently isn't used. The configuration will detect the
    presence of the spam header and then add the score you configure.

  $SpamFilterThreshold
    The $SpamFilterThreshold is the score above which an incoming message is
    considered to be spam and placed in the spam list.
